# Digital contact tracing for SARS-COV-2

In our *Science* paper <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb6936" target="_blank">*Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing*</a> we show that the spread of COVID-19 is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing alone but could be controlled if contact tracing was faster, more efficient and happened at scale, including via a mobile phone app. We present the results of our mathematical models of infectiousness and interventions in this <a href="https://bdi-pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes/" target="_blank">Shiny web application</a>, through which users can test the effects of alternative infection parameters.

To run it locally, clone or download this repository and execute `shiny::runApp('global.R')`. If using RStudio this can also be achieved by opening any of the `.R` files and clicking on "Run App". Please note that if any of the packages on which it depends (listed below) are missing, it will fail to run until they have all been installed. 

Depends: R (â‰¥ 3.6.3), shiny, ggplot2, RColorBrewer, tidyr, shinyjs, shinythemes, shinycssloaders, gridExtra, Cairo, markdown, tidyverse, viridis
