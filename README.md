# Digital contact tracing for SARS-COV-2

In our *Science* paper <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abb6936" target="_blank">Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing</a> we show that the spread of COVID-19 is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing alone but could be controlled if contact tracing was faster, more efficient and happened at scale, including via a mobile phone app. We present the results of our mathematical models of infectiousness and interventions in this <a href="https://bdi-pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes/" target="_blank">Shiny web application</a>, through which users can test the effects of alternative infection parameters.
